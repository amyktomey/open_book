        <p class = "intro">“Open Book Catering” (Feed Your Imagination) 
          <br>
          This has been a concept in my mind for some time. As a child, I would read 
          anything I could get my hands on. Adventure, mystery, romance… the setting 
          didn’t matter as long as the plot was good. I would get as many books as was 
          allowed (19 a week) and couldn’t wait till Library Friday when I could find 
          a new world to explore. </p>
        <p>My grandmother also had a full bookcase and I would hide under the covers 
          pretending to sleep, while reading her books. As I grew older, acting was 
          another outlet for my creativity. I would lose myself in books and characters, 
          as an escape from whatever troubles I had at the time.</p>
        <p>Books will forever be a part of my life. Eeveryone needs a little imagination 
          to thrive. These experiences have impacted me in a positive way and I want to 
          share this with everyone. I will give more than just good food. My customers 
          will receive an experience that they will remember forever. The goal is to feed 
          body and soul, providing an escape from the real world for a little while. This 
          is why imagination is so important. It helps get you through the long monotonous 
          days and give joy when everything seems hopeless. It’s what feeds the soul.

        <p>Louisville is the perfect place to start my catering business. People come from 
          out of town looking for new and exciting adventures. There is always some event 
          taking place. From the Jane Austen festival and Comicon to the Renaissance Faire, 
          there is never a dull moment. </p>
        <p>The Kentucky Derby season is also a large attraction and is a busy time for caterers. 
          We (KY) also host a variety of theaters, theme parks, and experiences such as the 
          Bourbon Trail and Light up Louisville. All of this combined makes my location the ideal 
          setting for my target demographic.</p>
        <p>For me, catering will start as a mobile business. I will be cooking in test kitchens. 
          I plan on doing events mainly in the homes of my clients, but places like The Brown and 
          The Palace will hold events for parties and groups larger than 20. Events in homes will 
          be limited to 20 guests or less depending on available space. This will give a more 
          personal experience for the enjoyment of my client’s guests.
