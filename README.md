# open_book
This is my final project for JavaScript 2021.   [Remove brackets as each part becomes operational. 
VERIFY WHAT WORKS BEFORE EACH SUBMIT!!!!!]

"Open Book" introduces a new concept in catering, coming to Louisville, KY in 2022.

The welcome page is the launchpad, linking you to each line of business under the "Open Book" umbrella. Here you will find a registration form for newsletters and updates. Name and email validation added.
Vision will give you personal insight to why the creator developed this unique brand of personal service.

Creations is the beginning of it all... featuring a carousel of images from a scrapbook of cakes past. [there is a form that will get an estimate for cost, based on type and number of servings needed] 

The Dinners page features a disappearing menu and a checklist to identify dietary restrictions.  A calculator provides an estimate depending on the number of courses and number of guests.

Confections is new in 2020, when she started the handmade chocolates/bonbons line. [Visitors can enter flavors to check availability, and submit a special request if their flavor is unavailble.]

[edit this below...]
I used CSS on all logos, images and buttons. I added one media query for > 600px.  I used unordered lists for navigation and the ingredients on the confections page. I made one ordered list for the view/hide menu.  CSS did the heavy work of formatting and adding colors and borders to make it pleasing to the eye. JS runs the carousel, forms and information collection.
