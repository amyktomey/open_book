# open_book

project website, capstone

This is a work in progress for a new concept in catering, coming to Louisville, KY in 2022.

Initially, there is a welcome page, with links to each individual line of business underneath the name "Open Book".

There are different forms for requesting information for catering, confections and creations.

Sample menus and photos will be added, as well as contact info on the main page.
