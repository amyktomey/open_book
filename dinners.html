    <h1>Open Book Catering</h1>
      <h2>Dinner Parties & Events</h2>
      <br>
    <p>Open Book Catering will give customers the option of at least three different experiences taken from the pages of books and stories.
       I will use these to create an atmosphere reflecting particular genres. This ‘immersion experience’ will include costumes, décor, music
        and most importantly, food. We will offer Fantasy, Mythological, and Historical experience. Each dining experience will be served as a
         3 to 5 course meal depending on the client’s budget.
         <br>

    <br>
    <p>in here, we will insert a quote request form, which will allow visitors to identify any special needs such as: diabetic, food allergies, etc.
      It will also request the type/style of party or event and estimated number of guests.</p>
