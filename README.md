# open_book
This is my final project for JavaScript 2021. It is the FEWD project, much improved.  :tada: :sparkles: :fireworks:

(*all changes in italics*}

"Open Book" introduces a new concept in catering, coming to Louisville, KY in 2022.

The welcome page is the launchpad, linking you to each line of business under the "Open Book" umbrella. Here you will find a registration form for newsletters and updates. *Name and email validation added to each page as neeeded.*

Vision will give you personal insight to why the creator developed this unique brand of personal service.

Creations is the beginning... featuring a *carousel of images* from a scrapbook of cakes past. *Saves requests to external file (notepad).* :cake:

The Dinners page features a *hidden menu.  A calculator provides an estimate depending on the number of courses and guests. Saves requests to external file (notepad).*

Confections is new in 2020, when she started the handmade chocolates/bonbons line. :candy:

I used CSS on all logos, images and buttons. I added media queries for smaller than 400px and greater than 600px.  I used unordered lists for navigation and the ingredients on the confections page. I made one ordered list for the hidden menu.  CSS did the heavy work of formatting and adding colors and borders to make it pleasing to the eye. JS runs the carousel, forms and information collection.

I opened the website in Chrome, Edge, and Avast (a secured browser) for testing.
