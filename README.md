# open_book
This is my final project for JavaScript 2021. I have updated my FEWD project. Changes are indicated with **.

"Open Book" introduces a new concept in catering, coming to Louisville, KY in 2022.

The welcome page is the launchpad, linking you to each line of business under the "Open Book" umbrella. Here you will find a registration form for newsletters and updates. ** Name and email validation added.

Vision will give you personal insight to why the creator developed this unique brand of personal service.

Creations is the beginning of it all... featuring a **carousel of images from a scrapbook of cakes past. ** Saves request to external file (notepad).

The Dinners page features a hidden menu and  ** an estimate calculator, based on the number of courses and guests.

Confections is new in 2020, when she started the handmade chocolates/bonbons line. 

I used CSS on all logos, images and buttons. I added media queries for Smaller than 400px and greater than 600px.  I used an unordered list for the ingredients on the confections page. I made one ordered list for the hidden menu.  CSS also did the heavy work of formatting and adding colors and borders to make it pleasing to the eye. JS runs the carousel, verifications and information collection.

I opened the website in Chrome, Edge, and Avast (a secured browser) for testing.
