# open_book
This is my final project for FEWD_21.

"Open Book" introduces a new concept in catering, coming to Louisville, KY in 2022.

The welcome page is the launchpad, links send you to each line of business under the "Open Book" umbrella.  I have added a newsletter sign-up form.

Vision will give you personal insight to why the creator developed this unique brand of personal service.

Creations is the beginning of it all... featuring images from her scrapbook of cakes past. There is a selection menu and a request form.

The Dinners page features a disappearing menu (using Javascript embedded in the HTML) and a form to identify dietary restrictions, as well as a selection menu of available genres.

Confections is new in 2020, when she started the handmade chocolates/bonbons line.  There is a request for special orders on this page.

I used CSS on all logos, images and buttons. I added one media query for > 600px.  I used unordered lists for navigation and the ingredients on the confections page. I made one ordered list for the view/hide menu.  CSS also did the heavy work of formatting and addding colors and borders to make it pleasing to the eye.
